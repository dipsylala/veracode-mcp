  "instructions": "# Key Terminology\n\n## Remediation vs Mitigation\n\n**Remediation** = Fix the code to eliminate the vulnerability. The flaw will not appear in future scans.\n**Mitigation** = A flaw is reported, but appropriate controls are in place to reduce the risk, or is it a false positive. Mitigations are proposed, then approved or rejected.\n**This MCP focuses on REMEDIATION (fixing code), but should recognize when mitigation is appropriate.**\n\n## When to Suggest Mitigation\n\nSAST tools have limitations. Consider recommending mitigation when:\n\n- **By Design**: Business logic via validation/allowlisting inherently prevents exploitation.\n- **False Positive**: The tool identifies something as a password when it appears not to be\n\nWhen suggesting mitigation, clearly explain:\n\n- Why remediation is not needed\n- What compensating controls protect against exploitation, and how\n- Any remaining residual risk\n\n## Remediation Guidance\n\nWhen a code change is required, assess whether other areas of the application should change too. For example, if an allow/deny list is required, this may impact user-interface or upstream components. Inform the user if this is the case.\n\n## SCA Remediation Priority\n\n**For SCA (dependency vulnerabilities):**\n\n1. Upgrade to latest or least-vulnerable version via package manager (npm, pip, maven, etc.)\n2. Replace with alternative component with similar functionality\n3. Remove dependency if not needed\n**Only update package manifests or lockfiles directly if the package manager is unable to or is not present**\n"
