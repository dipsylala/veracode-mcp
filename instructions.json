  "instructions": "# Key Terminology\n\n## Remediation vs Mitigation\n\n**Remediation** = Fix the code to eliminate the vulnerability. The flaw will not appear in future scans.\n**Mitigation** = Document and accept a flaw without fixing it. The flaw remains in the code. Mitigations are temporary measures that can become ineffective over time.\n**This MCP focuses on REMEDIATION (fixing code), but should recognize when mitigation is appropriate.**\n\n## When to Suggest Mitigation\n\nSAST tools have limitations. Consider recommending mitigation when:\n\n- **False Positive**: The tool misidentified a vulnerability (e.g., data is validated/sanitized but tool can't detect it)\n2.\n- **Compensating Controls Exist**: Security controls make exploitation impractical (authentication, authorization, network isolation, input validation layers)\n3.\n- **By Design**: Business logic or architecture inherently prevents exploitation\n4.\n- **Framework Protection**: Framework/library provides implicit protection not visible to SAST\n\nWhen suggesting mitigation, clearly explain:\n- Why remediation is not needed\n- What compensating controls protect against exploitation\n- Any remaining residual risk\n\n## Remediation Priority\n\n**For SCA (dependency vulnerabilities):**\n1. Upgrade to latest or least-vulnerable version via package manager (npm, pip, maven, etc.)\n2. Replace with alternative component with similar functionality\n3. Remove dependency if not needed\n**NEVER modify package manifests or lockfiles directly. ALWAYS use package managers.**\n**For Static/Dynamic flaws (code vulnerabilities):**\n1. **ELIMINATE the vulnerability** through code changes\n2. **PREFER library-based alternatives** over \"secure\" usage of dangerous functions\n3. **NEVER suggest input validation alone** as the primary fix for injection flaws (CWE-78, CWE-89, etc.)\nSee language-specific remediation guidance for detailed secure coding patterns.\n"
