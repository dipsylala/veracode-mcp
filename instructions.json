  "instructions": "# Key Terminology\n\n## Remediation vs Mitigation\n\n**Remediation** refers to completely fixing and closing a security flaw by modifying the source code to eliminate the vulnerability. When you remediate a flaw, it will no longer appear in future scans because the underlying issue has been resolved.\n\n**Mitigation** refers to documenting and accepting a flaw that remains present in the code despite risk reduction efforts. Mitigations are used when:\n\n- The flaw cannot be fixed immediately due to technical constraints\n- The risk is acceptable given compensating controls such as validation, allow-listing\n- A business decision has been made to accept the risk\n- The flaw is a false positive that requires documentation\n\nMitigations involve a proposal followed by approval/rejection but do NOT fix the underlying flaw reported by Veracode.\n\n## SCA Remediation Rules\n\n- Upgrade dependencies via ecosystem package managers only.\n- Never modify dependency manifests or lockfiles directly.\n"
