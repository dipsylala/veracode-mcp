# LLM Guidance Output

This directory contains LLM-enhanced security guidance generated by the Ralph Wiggum Loop script.

## About

The files in this directory are automatically generated from `../guidance/` using:

```bash
python scripts/generate_llm_guidance.py
```

**Important:** This directory contains generated content. The source of truth is `../guidance/`, which comes from the source at [https://dipsylala.github.io/FlawFixingGuidance/](https://dipsylala.github.io/FlawFixingGuidance/)

## Contents

- **CWE-*/** - Enhanced CWE guidance directories (mirrors `../guidance/` structure)
- **LLM_GUIDANCE_SPEC.md** - Specification and progress tracking
- **LLM_REVIEW_LOG.md** - Processing log with timestamps
- **llm_audit/** - Detailed audit logs of LLM interactions

## Generation Process

1. **LLM Mode** (default): Uses GitHub Copilot CLI to intelligently enhance guidance
2. **Deterministic Fallback**: Applies rule-based transformations if LLM unavailable

Each file is processed according to `LLM_GUIDANCE_SPEC.md` and categorized by vulnerability type to apply appropriate:

- Remediation strategies
- Language-specific safe patterns (Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Go, etc.)
- Minimal safe code examples

## Non-Destructive

Original files in `../guidance/` are never modified. All output goes to this directory.

## Configuration

Set environment variables before running:

- `RW_LLM=0` - Disable LLM mode, use only deterministic transforms
- `RW_COPILOT_CMD=copilot` - Override Copilot CLI command

## Review Workflow

1. Run the script to generate enhanced guidance
2. Review generated files in this directory
3. Compare with originals in `../guidance/`
4. Manually merge desired changes back to `../guidance/`
